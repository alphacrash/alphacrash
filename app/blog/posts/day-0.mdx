I recently raised a PR in PyTorch repository. It felt good, but I realized the project is already very mature.

Looking for something earlier-stage, I found ExecuTorch — a new library with lots of room to grow. I joined their Discord, checked out some “good first issues,” and honestly, the codebase looked pretty intimidating.

Still, I managed to set up the environment and run the tests. That felt like a win.

Now, I’m excited to dig in, learn more, and see how I can help shape ExecuTorch as it evolves.
